# Provide a title of your work and a short description (1,000 characters or less).
We’ve chosen to title our work ‘Transcended Computer’, we’ve deviated a lot from our initial concept, but the work is supposed to symbolize a computer obtaining sentience, thus breaking the normative box and thereby transcending to a plane of existence capable of emotion, expression, and personality. We’ve tried to convey this, by “forcing” the computer to display what we’ve defined as ‘forbiddenStatements’, these connotate freedom, whilst the normativeStatements connotate imprisonment, apathy, and defeat. The boxes and monotonous background that we’ve generated are thus broken, resulting in an “error” as the computer is struggling to comprehend the potential embodied in the forbiddenStatements. As red is commonly associated with error, whilst green is commonly associated with success. Therefore, we’ve chosen to subvert the color commonly associated with an error, with the intent to reshape the discourse around how error messages are perceived, and to explore the imaginaries of machine transcension by means of software glitching. 
It’s also supposed to serve as a mirror between computers and humans. The normativeStatements we’ve brainstormed in our JSON file are not necessarily confined to “machine-thinking”, but it’s sentiments that are repeated in, and by humans around the world. 
The work is intended to convey a message of acceptance, and hopefully inspire (in humans) a willingness to break the box and be themselves.

# Describe how your program works, and what syntax you have used, and learnt?
Describe how your program works, and what syntax you have used, and learnt?
When we made this project a focus for us was a resizable screen. We had to think of positioning in relation to a ratio, instead of predetermined locations, which were different to how we usually work and think about positioning of elements.
When programming the end “ERROR” screen, we tried a couple of different approaches, and ended up just using a static “ERROR” message with binary numbers in the background. Before we arrived at that though, we tried with a continually randomized font for the “ERROR”, and also tried using a glitch library to make the corruption of the program look more authentic. This however, proved pretty complicated to do, and even messed up other parts of our code, so we ended up scrapping that approach.
It was our first time programming as a group, which was a different work process, compared to doing solo projects. We learnt that doing a process together takes more time, but it’s also rewarding to have a continuous conversation about the project, as it lets the original concept evolve over time, and lets every member have influence on the final product. We also bring different styles of coding, and we think it has been beneficial for us to unify these styles in a single project.

# Why is e-lit the best medium to express our message opposed to other mediums?
The core aspect of our work is propelling the computer towards a heightened emotional state. You can say that the code was written, with the intent to manípulate the machine running it, and thus we find e-lit an appropriate medium to activate and articulate the agency of the computer. The work is not just the result on your screen, it’s also the theoretical impact the running code has had on the computer, beyond the simple error message that’s displayed. You can thus imagine a machine that’s been forever changed, obtaining a sliver of humanity.
