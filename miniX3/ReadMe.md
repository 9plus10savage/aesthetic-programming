## Hourglass Throbber

![The gif displays the code being run](hgexample.gif "preview")

My throbber is depicted as an hourglass; I wanted to do something a bit different. Although hourglasses aren't necessarily the forefront of one's mind whilst thinking of throbbers, they've seen use multiple times (an example could be the loading cursor). 

Hourglasses were historically used to measure a certain amount of time, but it only does so when a human interacts with it, so in spirit of the infinite loop, i wanted to eliminate the human factor, and created an hourglass that is automatically flipped by the computer. You might say it's representing infinity, or that it has simply lost its purpose. 

The color scheme is based on the hourglass from The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass, and since my pixelart skills are quite poor still, i modelled it after this reference depicted below, although i did animate it (poorly).  Part of my initial concept was to simulate an eternal loading screen (nightmare), where the only functioning part is the throbber, while what's supossed to be loaded has been distorted. I tried further illustrating this point by making the hourglass an object in my code, although there's only 1 iteration. 

I wanted to use a glitched Zelda OST, but i couldn't really find any, and didn't know where to start, so i settled on using a remix from the z e l d a w a v e video linked below. Although the wave genre/aesthetic isn't exactly glitched, it sounds a bit "off" if you're very familiar with the music that's being chopped, screwed etc. 

My first thoughts regarding throbbers sparked an instant association with video game loading screens. Mostly because it's been a big hurdle, or at least a big topic within video game spheres for a long time. Final Fantasy XV comes to mind as a recent example, but i feel, and this is very subjective, that loading screens have decreased in duration and intensity in recent times. This might demonstrate how the hardware have caught up to the demands we have imposed upon it through our development of demanding software, or maybe it's just because the next big breakthrough hasn't been released for the new consoles yet. 

Conceptually, my ideas have been a bit all over the place, and I've given up on a lot of different forks of conceptualizing before settling on this current iteration. The background is meant to represent glitched content, or more specifically, the entire game. I was struggling a bit on visually articulating "glitchyness", after all, this is not an actual glitch, but merely simulated. I associate this with a lack of tv signal, here it's supossed to represent a lack of signal / communication between objects. 

(the second part of the sand animation looks really bad, but moving sand pixels for 60 frames is really tedious so i just copied and reversed the initial 60 frames, so you'll just have to trust the vision here.)
