The program looks very bad if you're not fullscreen (F11), you might have to zoom out. 

I've decided to title my project 'The heart of capitalist media." After gaining perspective on data gathering, and the ubiquitous datafication of our lives through Mejias, Ulises A. and Nick Couldry's "Datafication". I wanted to highlight the inevitability of data capture in modern capitalist society.

I wanted to move past my initial thoughts, which boiled down to: "data capture bad.". I feel this sentiment is heavily echoed throughout the assigned material. The framing in the VPRO documentary with Shoshana Zuboff highlights this clearly; It's almost ominous, and the narrative clearly creates this personification of big data as a corporate monster, motivated by greed, but then again, most humans are motivated by greed as well. I think the debate regarding data capture can be extended, and the implications these established data-gathering structures have on our society are immense. There's a lot of actors, algorithms, corporations, activists, ideologies at play here, and they weave a heaviliy tangled web. I don't think the discussion around data capture can be adressed, without acknowledging how deeply ingrained these structures are in our society.

Our consumption of media has been steadily increasing throughout the 21st century, and a lot of the media we consume are monitized through ads, whose effeciency/reach are in turn optimized through data gathering. I wanted to encapsulate this within my project: Giving the user the option to accept the installation of Adblock and declining cookies. Although not entirely accurate, they're supposed to represent the artist's conditions for monetization of said content. Thus showing a scenario, where all the media you consume, cannot stay afloat, due to the heavy reliance on data as capital.

Media consumption can also be regarded as a necessity for participating in capitalist society. Whether the rapidly increasing media consumption is due to capitalist society exacerbating the need for escapism and catalyzing the florishing of depressingly nihilistic thoughts within it's consumers or not is also a topic of discussion. It might be the root-cause of the seemingly inherent need for a constant stream of media. Following this train of thought, you might argue that they poisoned the world and sold the cure. 

The end sequence was intended as depicting a crumbling internet, revealing our own data being the source / heart of large parts of the internet. It's so intertwined and somewhat absurd if you really think about it. Individuals reduced to- and abstracted as numbers, whose numbers are used to generate numbers, so the profit from the individual's spending can be maximized. All for some pasty white men's fragile egos, built on arbitrary numbers. It's quite disempowering really. Just being a number, producing numbers. The scope of it all is daunting, and swimming against the current feels evermore redundant. Something something positive nihilism, the small things, positive note. 

Moving on from the drama; The code is a bit messy. I think it's quite hard incorporating what I'd call 'states' in p5. Here I've done it through a long conditional statement. There's a natural linear progression which should be followed, and then the buttons somewhat alter this path, might be considered as different forks; It's like a bad end vs. good end. There's a lot of text, and i struggled a bit with the fonts. The added classes are styled through CSS (style.css), although i couldn't get CSS animations to work properly. 

There's one big bug, that I can't seem to fix. When you've clicked a button a second time, the content "stage" pops up, but if you double click, sometimes it instantly "skips" the stage, eventhough there should be a counter, that restricts this behavior. I've tried a lot of different things, but i can't 100% fix it.
